CREATING METHODS:

Public - method can be called outside of it's class
Static -  a method that belongs to a class not an object

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
       String name1 =  greetUser("Tom", "Fyfe");
       String name2 =  greetUser("John", "Spartan");
        System.out.println(name1);
        System.out.println(name2);

    }

    public static String greetUser(String firstName, String lastName){
        return "Hello " + firstName + " " + lastName;
    }

}

REFACTORING:
Changing the structure of your code without changing its behaviour

Methods should be no longer than 20 lines
When refactoring, look for 2 concepts or lines of code that always got together

Make new method to do a task in the code. It should be reusable.
IE a method for calculating the mortgage

Look for repetitive patterns in the code - IE the while loops in the mortgage calculator.


REFACTORING REPETITIVE PATTERNS:
Make a generic function that can handle the logic of similar functionality in a large code block,
IE infinite while loops doing similar error handling.
