Project - Payment Schedule
The next formula is used to calculate the remaining loan balance (B)
of a fixed payment loan after p months.
B = L[(1 + c)n - (1 + c)p]/[(1 + c)n - 1]

L = principle
c = monthly interest
n = number of payments -  12 per year
p = number of payments made

Multiply L by [(1 + c)n - (1 + c)p]

then divide by

[(1 + c)n - 1]

make a new method for calculating the remaining payments
Use a loop to run for number of months period, this decrements and is an
argument for the remainingPau
print result of method per iteration

In method create a dynamic variable for number of payments,
