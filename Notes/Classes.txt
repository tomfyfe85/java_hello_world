Classes and Objects:

A classes is a blueprint or a template for creating objects.

eg:
CAR object
fields - started, current speed, currentGear
methods - Start/Stop/Brake/changeGear

EG when we call changeGear, the value of current gear changes

Creating Classes:

Public - Class is visible to all other classes in the package
use Pascal to name the Class
use camel to name the fields

When the name of a parameter is the same as the field name,
use this. "field name"

the field's state is changed by the methods


    public static void main(String[] args) {
        var textBox1 = new TextBox();
    }
var - Java complier will detect the type of this variable
based on what we have on the right hand side of the =
