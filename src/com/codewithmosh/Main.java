//Project - Mortgage calculator
//when you run program =>

//Principal: (amount of loan I want to get e.g. 100000)
//Annual interest rate: (IE %3.92) = actual interest is .0392 as it was represented as a % -
//-so what every the user enters, divide by 100 then 12
//Period (years): (e.g. 30 years) = multiply by 12 to get number of monthly payments
//=>
//Mortgage: Â£472.81

//first 3 are questions. Mortgage should return your monthly payment
// wikihow.com/Calculate-Mortage-Payments
//use Math.pow to raise number power of N where N is no of payments


//Principal: (amount of loan I want to get e.g. 100000)
//Annual interest rate: e.g. %3.45
//Period (years): e.g. 56
